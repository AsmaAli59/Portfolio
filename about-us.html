                <h5>Front-end Developer & <span>Designer</span></h5>
                <p>Hello, I'm Asma Ali, a computer science graduate with a profound passion for technology and a
                    creative edge. My expertise extends across a spectrum of skills, including graphic design,
                    Excel-driven data analysis, and adept handling of Amazon virtual assistant tasks. As a strong
                    communicator, I thrive in seamless collaboration within diverse teams,
                    adapting effectively to challenges while consistently contributing fresh perspectives.
                    In addition to my proficiency in technology, I bring a strong foundation in web design and
                    development to the table.
                    With a keen eye for aesthetics and a knack for creating engaging online experiences, I am excited to
                    integrate my technical proficiency and artistic flair to deliver holistic solutions in dynamic
                    environments.
                    Whether it's crafting visually appealing websites or analyzing complex datasets, I am driven by a
                    passion to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and
                    design.</p>
